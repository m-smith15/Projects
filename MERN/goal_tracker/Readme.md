## General Information
- Personally, I'm someone who is goal oriented. However, I find that sometimes its easy to loose track of a goal if its been some time - or if you don't check in on it.
  - This site is meant to be a personalized tracker - designed for simple and easy use to check in, edit, or create new goals to be tracked.

## Technologies Used
  - MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)

## Big takeaways
- Creating a login and registration page
- Securing pw info via Bcrypt


## Setup
Dependencies are located in the package.json


## Usage
You can either register as a new user, or if testing use a trial user whos information is on the login page. 
  - Once logged in, you can view previous goals, add to them progress or obstacles, or complete them.


## Project Status
Project is: _in progress_! 
  - I built much of the framework while attending the Coding Dojo coding bootcamp, but did not have much time to flesh it out as much as I'd like. I'm going to continue working on this in my free time


## Room for Improvement
  - The frontend needs work. For now, the steelblue background is simply there for when I'm working at night. Its a little more gentle on my eyes!
  - Add a "completed" status and send those goals away from view, but available in an archive.
  - Possibly look into adding a browser extension that has current goals. This way if you're setting up your calendar for the week, you can glance back at what you set up!
