## Python Projects!

# Test_Discord_Bot
  - This was a goofy project I threw together as a joke for some of my buddies on our private Discord server. A fun delve into the world of .env and how some of the bigger Discord bots work!

# offline_auction_house
 - This is the Offline Auction House project that I created from the ground up following successful completion of my Python stack while enrolled in Coding Dojo!

# Yolts_bolts
  - This is very barebones, but is a framework for a friend who does some freelance work. He approached me while I was in the bootcamp and asked about building a website. The structure I created and am waiting to hear back on are here!
