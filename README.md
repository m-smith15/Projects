# Projects & Belt Exams

Here is where I store some of my personal projects that I'm working on, separated by language!

I enrolled and completed an intensive 3 stack 1000+ hour coding bootcamp through Coding Dojo. The certifications to be awarded a coveted "black belt" in the stack exam involved deploying the site publicly. You'll find the applications I built in under 5 hours and deployed separated by language (Python, Java, Mern) in the "belt_exams" folder. A link to the site as well as a pre-built user's credentials will be available to test drive the sites!
