# Pirate belt exam
  - The prompt for the exam was to create a fully CRUD site using the MERN stack that was based around creating a pirate crew. Some of the extra challenges included adding in validations to fields, media images, and deploying the site so it is accessable anywhere!
  
 - The look and feel of the site is a little rough, as we were only given 5 hours to complete this. Apologies in advance for the onslaught of steelblue!
